    <h1 id="title">Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>December 3, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Ivy / Ivify</strong> (the “App”, “we”, “us” or “our”). These Terms of Use ("Terms") explain the rules for using our mobile application and related services that let you track debts, reminders, and backups. By downloading, accessing, or using the App you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. About the App</h2>
    <p>The App helps users record and manage debts given to customers or friends, track due dates, log payments, send reminders, and optionally back up data to cloud storage (premium feature). The App is built primarily for local business owners and individuals who want a digital replacement for paper ledger books.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. If you are under 18, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian to use the App in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3. Accounts and Verification</h2>
    <p>Certain features may require that you create an account or verify contact details. Verification and support contact can be done from the app's Settings &gt; About screen. You agree to provide accurate information and to keep your account details secure. You are responsible for all activity that happens using your account.</p>

    <h2>4. Local Storage & Backups</h2>
    <p><strong>Local-first storage:</strong> By default, your data (debt records, contacts, payment logs, reminders) is stored on your device so the App works offline.</p>
    <p><strong>Manual and automatic backups:</strong> You may manually export or back up your data. We offer an optional automatic cloud backup (premium). You are responsible for keeping copies of your exported data. We do our best to safeguard backups, but we do not guarantee recovery in all cases.</p>

    <h2>5. Access to Contacts & Communication</h2>
    <p>The App may request access to your phone contacts so you can add debtors directly from your contacts list. The App also uses the device's sharing capabilities and may open third-party apps (WhatsApp, SMS, phone dialer, email) when you choose to contact someone. You agree that the App may initiate these actions but that delivery and behaviour are controlled by those third-party apps.</p>

    <h2>6. Notifications and Reminders</h2>
    <p>The App can schedule local notifications to remind you about upcoming or overdue debts. Notifications rely on your device settings; you must enable notifications and allow the App to send them. We are not responsible for missed reminders when push or local notifications are disabled or blocked by the device.</p>

    <h2>7. Free & Premium Features</h2>
    <p>The core tracking features are available for free. Additional services such as automatic cloud backup, multi-device sync, or advanced reporting may be offered under a paid subscription ("Premium"). All payment-related terms (billing, cancellations, refunds) are handled by the payment provider you use (App Store, Play Store, or other) and their rules apply.</p>

    <h2>8. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for entering accurate debt and payment information.</li>
      <li>You must ensure that you have permission to store or use contact details from your address book.</li>
      <li>When contacting debtors or customers, you must comply with local laws and act respectfully and legally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy. Your data is primarily stored on your device and is not shared with third parties without your consent, except as needed for backup or to comply with law. For full details, please see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> (posted on our website).</p>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and all content, branding, and software are the intellectual property of Ivify (or its licensors). You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal or business record keeping under these Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App. We do not guarantee the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that data will always be recoverable. Your use is at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your breach of these Terms, your misuse of the App, or your violation of any law.</p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the App if you violate these Terms or for security or legal reasons. Termination does not relieve you of obligations incurred prior to termination, including unpaid fees.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated Terms with a new effective date. Continued use of the App after updates means you accept the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>15. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may integrate with third-party services (e.g., cloud backup providers, WhatsApp, SMS gateways, device sharing). These third parties have separate terms and privacy policies which you must review. We are not responsible for third-party practices or outages.</p>

    <h2>16. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Nigeria. Any dispute arising from these Terms will be resolved by the competent courts in Nigeria, unless we both agree to arbitration or an alternative dispute resolution.</p>

    <h2>17. Contact & Support</h2>
    <p>If you need help, have questions, or want to report abuse, open the App &gt; Settings &gt; About &gt; Contact Support, or email us at <a href="mailto:support@ivify.com.ng">support@ivify.com.ng</a>.</p>

    <h2>18. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>If any part of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full effect. These Terms, together with any Privacy Policy and other legal notices we post, form the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App.</p>
